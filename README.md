# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-for-YULU-Electric-Bike

Removing Outliers:

Identify and remove any data points that are considered outliers, which can significantly impact the analysis and interpretation of the data.
Changing "datetime" Column:

Convert the "datetime" column from the object type to the datetime data type to enable easier manipulation and analysis of time-related data.
Checking for Null Values:

Examine the dataset for any missing or null values that may require handling. If found, consider imputing missing values or removing affected rows, depending on the extent of missing data.
Correlation Between Variables:

Calculate the correlation coefficient between different variables, such as temperature, weather conditions, or time of day, and the number of electric bike rentals. This analysis can help identify relationships and dependencies between variables.
Data Visualization:

Create visualizations, such as histograms, line plots, or scatter plots, to explore the distribution and patterns within the dataset. Visualizations can provide insights into trends, seasonality, and relationships between variables.
Hypothesis Testing:

Perform hypothesis tests to validate specific assumptions or statements about the data. Two examples of hypothesis tests for YULU electric bikes are:
Hypothesis 1: Assess if working days have a significant effect on the number of electric bike rentals. Formulate null and alternative hypotheses and conduct an appropriate statistical test.
Hypothesis 2: Determine if the number of bike rentals differs significantly across different seasons. Formulate null and alternative hypotheses and use statistical tests .
